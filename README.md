# VibeCoded-Portfolio ✦

> Built with vibes, not sanity.

A personal portfolio I vibe coded using **Antigravity** + **Whisk** for animations — because why use boring scroll libraries when you can throw physics at it?

## ⚡ What's This

Because static portfolios are boring. Because experimenting publicly > planning forever. Because I like testing new AI builders and pushing them beyond templates.
This repo is part of that playground.
No overthinking. Just ship.
